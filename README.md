# The python code for the paper "Online Optimal Tracking of Linear Systems with Adversarial Disturbances"

The purpose of this repository is to reproduce the simulation results in the following paper. Some lines of the code is taken and inspired by deluca: A library for RL with derivatives.

```


##  Before running
Make sure to install the required libraries before running the results


## Reproducing the main simulation results
To reproduce the main simulation results, run
 *[main_various_dist.py](main_various_dist.py)
 Uncomment the disturbance that you would like to see the result and comment other disturbances.
 
 
## Reproducing the simulation results when the reference generator dynamic changes
To reproduce the simulation results for changing reference generator, run
 *[main_changing_reference.py](main_changing_reference.py)
 Uncomment the disturbance that you would like to see the result and comment other disturbances.
